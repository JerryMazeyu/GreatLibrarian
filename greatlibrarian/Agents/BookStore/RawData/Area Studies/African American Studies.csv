Cover of 101 African Americans Who Shaped South Carolina,,,,,,,,"The South Carolina Encyclopedia was published in 2006 to be a “people’s encyclopedia,” a comprehensive single-volume print reference for anything that anyone wanted to know about the Palmetto State’s rich cultures and storied heritage, from prehistory to the present. Including nearly two thousand entries and five hundred illustrations, the encyclopedia was the result of a six-year collaboration between the Humanities CouncilSC, the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South Carolina, and the University of South Carolina Press. Nearly six hundred contributors came together to write more than one million words depicting our state’s representative people, places, and things...."
"Cover of Aaron McDuffie Moore: An African American Physician, Educator, and Founder of Durham's Black Wall Street",,,,,,,,"The idea for this book converged from several avenues. We knew that future generations of both our family members and historians needed well-researched, accurate information about what motivated my maternal great-grandfather, Dr. Aaron McDuffie Moore, to accomplish so much. We were determined to provide an accurate, authoritative reference source. My father, Dr. Charles DeWitt Watts, left a treasure trove of information about Moore, who was his grandfather-in-law. Among the saved material, we found previously unpublished references about Moore’s daily struggles and his broad impact on health care during the early 1900s. Dad seemed to be urging me to develop this..."
"Cover of Abandoned Tracks: The Underground Railroad in Washington County, Pennsylvania",,,,,,,,"The Underground Railroad has typically been described in terms of the “routes” that it operated for slaves escaping to freedom. For many reasons, however, the terminology of routes and the Underground Railroad metaphor associated with it can be extremely misleading. For starters, this terminology suggests that fugitive slaves were passive passengers aboard the Freedom Train and ignores the reality that many fugitives escaped on their own with minimal organized assistance. As David Smith has observed, “routes” also suggests that escapes from slavery were “too regularized.”¹ The “stations,” “conductors,” and “baggage” of the Underground Railroad metaphor lend themselves all too easily..."

Cover of Administering Freedom: The State of Emancipation after the Freedmen's Bureau,,,,,,,,"The Civil War’s casualty lists grew after 1865. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers carried wounds, ailments, and other traumas into their postwar lives, making recovery and reconstruction not only national tasks but intimate ones as well, as millions of ordinary Americans encountered and endured disability like never before. The task for many was finding a way to honor republican sacrifice without sacrificing republican honor, and with it the ideals of manly in dependence and productivity. Few veterans could dodge the prevailing Gilded Age antagonism toward disabled persons. Even those onlookers who maintained that “worthy” veterans deserved the nation’s material support..."
